## Exercise 55: Remove Extra Spaces from a String

## Objective
The primary objective of this exercise is to demonstrate proficiency in basic Python string manipulation by cleaning and standardizing text data. Specifically, to remove all forms of unnecessary whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) from a string, ensuring only a single space exists between words.

## Task
The task is to write a short Python script that takes a highly disorganized string containing various forms of excess whitespace and processes it to produce a clean, standardized output.

    messy_string = "   \n\t  Hello   World !  This  is messy. \t "
    (Note: This string includes leading/trailing spaces, newlines \n, tabs \t, and multiple internal spaces.)

## Expected Output
The final processed string should contain no leading or trailing whitespace and should have only a single space separating words and punctuation.
    
`Hello World ! This is messy.`
