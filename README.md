# 💯 100 Python Projects and Exercises Portfolio

## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository serves as a solutions set and portfolio for a challenging collection of 100 Python programming exercises. It is structured to provide a clear, logical progression through fundamental and advanced Python concepts, making it an excellent resource for anyone looking to master the language.

Each exercise is contained within its own dedicated, numbered directory for organization and easy review.

### Skills Demonstrated
* **Core Fundamentals:** Variables, data types, type conversion, and operators.
* **Structural Programming:** Control flow (conditionals, loops), functions, and modules.
* **Data Structures:** Efficient use of Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, and Tuples.
* **Practical Applications:** Solutions to mini-projects involving file handling, data processing, and simple algorithmic tasks.
