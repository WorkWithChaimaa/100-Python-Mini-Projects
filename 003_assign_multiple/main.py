# Exercise 3: Assign Multiple Variables in One Line

# 1. Assign values to three variables in a single line.
# This technique uses 'multiple assignment,' where variables on the left
# are matched positionally to values on the right.
python_students, java_students, ai_students = 25, 18, 12

# 2. Print the results using an f-string to match the expected output format.
print(f"Python = {python_students}, Java = {java_students}, AI = {ai_students}")
