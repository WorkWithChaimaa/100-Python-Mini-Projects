# Exercise 34: Manage a Shopping List

# 1. Initialize the shopping list with a list literal
shopping_list = ["Milk", "Eggs", "Bread"]

# 2. Add a new item using the .append() method
# This method modifies the list IN PLACE (a side effect).
shopping_list.append("Tomatoes")

# 3. Print the final, modified list
print(shopping_list)
